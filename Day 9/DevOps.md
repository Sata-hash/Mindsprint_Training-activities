# DevOps

DevOps is like a bridge between development and operations teams, aiming to streamline processes, improve collaboration, and deliver software more efficiently. It combines practices, tools, and cultural philosophies to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. This helps in shortening the development life cycle and providing continuous delivery with high software quality.
